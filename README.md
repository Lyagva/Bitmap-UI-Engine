## How to start
It's very ease, but I made full instruction step by step
(Also if you don't like reading, you can only follow bold text or look at second way)

1. **Clone** this repository using `git clone` (or some other ways like PyCharm built-ins)
2. **Install pygame** using `pip install pygame` (or using PyCharm libraries tab)
3. **Make new python file**
4. **Import App class** from `App.py` file 
5. **Inherit new class** (for example - `MyFirstApp`) from App class
6. **Add `onStart()`, `onUpdate()`, and `onDraw()` functions** to you class (`MyFirstApp`)
7. Out of class, **make new object** of your class (`MyFirstApp`) and then **use `Run()`** function to start your program
##### OR (Second way)
Just open `Main.py` file and edit it
